In the book entitled “Society and Technology Change”, Rudi Volti defines technology as “a system created by humans that uses knowledge and organization to produce objects and techniques for the attainment of specific goals.</p>

                            As with remote and IT support jobs, the pandemic has only pushed the need for individuals in cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is incredibly important to every business especially those dealing with customer data. With the risk of being fined millions if they have failed to set strong cybersecurity measures, businesses must ensure that they have professionals who are able to provide that security. According to research by Cybersecurity Professionals, there are predicted to be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs in the UK by 2021. If are looking to take on a tech role, then Cybersecurity could be for you.
